Object IDs in URNs look like

urn:cite2:citeecod:codsang250imgs.v1:sg250_218_217_0

where the 218 is the *preceding* page and the 217 is the *current* page

It would be nicer to base these on ecodices DOIs.

But that's not happening for the '21 hackathon.

so script for n in 2:650 and form 

(n-1)_n 

in template name string.

Use CitableImage to build a nice page.
